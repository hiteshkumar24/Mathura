                Early Settlements and Vedic Period
                Mathura's history dates back to ancient times, with evidence of human habitation found as early as the 6th century BCE. It is believed to have been a thriving center during the Vedic period, mentioned in ancient texts such as the Rigveda and the Mahabharata.

The city's prominence continued into the subsequent Shunga period, influencing the spread of Buddhism and Jainism. Mathura became known for its monasteries and religious edifices, reflecting the multicultural and religious diversity of ancient India.
                
                Kushan Dynasty (1st - 3rd Century CE)

                Early Buddhist Presence
                Mathura's association with Buddhism dates back to the time of Gautama Buddha (6th–5th century BCE) himself.

Early Buddhist texts and inscriptions mention Mathura as a hub for Buddhist monks and scholars.
                
                Art and Architecture
                Mathura became renowned for its distinctive style of Buddhist art and sculpture during the Kushan period (1st–3rd century CE). The city's artisans created exquisite sculptures depicting Buddha, Bodhisattvas, and scenes from Buddhist mythology. These sculptures often blended Indian artistic traditions with Hellenistic influences, reflecting the multicultural nature of the Kushan Empire.
                
                Buddhist Monasteries and Stupas
                Mathura was dotted with numerous Buddhist monasteries (viharas) and stupas, serving as centers of learning and meditation. These monastic complexes were adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures, symbolizing the spiritual and cultural vitality of Buddhism in the region. The presence of viharas provided a nurturing environment for monks and facilitated the spread of Buddhist teachings among local communities.
                
                Influence on Buddhist Philosophy
